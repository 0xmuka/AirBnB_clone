### This task involves implementing a system to store and retrieve instances of a `BaseModel` class using JSON serialization and deserialization. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Serialization and Deserialization**:
   - Serialization is the process of converting a Python object (in this case, instances of the `BaseModel` class) into a JSON string.
   - Deserialization is the process of converting a JSON string back into a Python object.

2. **File Storage Class**:
   - Create a class named `FileStorage` in `models/engine/file_storage.py`.
   - This class will handle the serialization and deserialization of instances to and from a JSON file.
   - It will have private class attributes `__file_path` (path to the JSON file) and `__objects` (a dictionary to store all objects by `<class name>.id`).

3. **Public Instance Methods**:
   - `all(self)`: Returns the dictionary `__objects`.
   - `new(self, obj)`: Adds the object to `__objects` with the key `<obj class name>.id`.
   - `save(self)`: Serializes `__objects` to the JSON file.
   - `reload(self)`: Deserializes the JSON file to `__objects` (only if the JSON file exists).

4. **Initialization in `__init__.py`**:
   - Import `FileStorage` into `models/__init__.py`.
   - Create a unique `FileStorage` instance named `storage`.
   - Call the `reload()` method on this instance.

5. **Integration with `BaseModel`**:
   - Import the `storage` instance into `models/base_model.py`.
   - In the `save(self)` method of `BaseModel`, call the `save(self)` method of `storage`.
   - In the `__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)` method of `BaseModel`:
     - If it's a new instance (not from a dictionary representation), call the `new(self)` method on `storage`.

6. **Testing**:
   - Create a test script (e.g., `test_save_reload_base_model.py`) to verify the functionality.
   - Instantiate `BaseModel` objects, set attributes, save them, and verify that they are properly stored and reloaded from the JSON file.

7. **JSON File Format**:
   - The JSON file will contain a dictionary where keys are `<class name>.id` and values are dictionaries representing the attributes of each object.
   - The JSON string representation should be human-readable and compatible with other programming languages.

By following these steps, we establish a system for persistent storage of `BaseModel` instances using JSON serialization and deserialization, allowing objects to be saved to and loaded from a file across program executions.
